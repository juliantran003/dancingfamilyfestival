        Dancing Family was founded by Yohan & Tatiana, 2 siblings who want to
        share their love for music and Family partying with the world. (include
        picture of the 2 of us here)  The family led event platform announces
        their first festival at Three Pools farm in South Wales from July 3-5,
        2025. Run by siblings Yohan and Tatiana de Ricard, Dancing Family has
        been facilitating events in South-East London since 2020. With
        appearances at venues like Corsica Studios, The Carpet Shop and Peckham
        Audio, the family run platform has been fostering a space for up-and
        coming artists within the London circuit for over 4 years. In search of
        another challenge and always looking to broaden their programming, the
        brother-sister duo will be bringing their family b2b programming to new
        heights. The family-centric gathering will take place on a permaculture
        farm near the small Welsh town of Abergavenny. As firm believers that
        intimate spaces make for the best dances, the festival will host 400
        people over the 3 day festivities. Guests will be encouraged to come
        with their family and chosen family. Spread over 3 days, Dancing Family
        will host over 30 family b2bs on two intimate stages. At the heart of
        this project is the siblings’ goal to bring together families within the
        realm of underground electronic dance music, and subsequently enable
        intergenerational partying within the scene. They are one of the only
        (if not the only in the UK) to program their events in this family b2b
        style and are strong advocates for a more wholesome party space. Yohan
        states that “creating a space where DJs can go b2b with their family
        facilitates a welcoming environment that shies away from intense and
        sometimes very dark atmospheres”.
